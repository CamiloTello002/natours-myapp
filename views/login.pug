  this login file takes the base.pug file (which is served in the views folder) and injects the block content code
  into the base.

  So, in my case, it means I need to include the login.js file since it'll take the form and submit the data
  edit 1: NO, it's already included in the base file

extends base

block content
  main.main
    .login-form
      h2.heading-secondary.ma-bt-lg Log into your account
      form.form.form--login
        .form-group
          label.form__label(for='email') Email address
          input#email.form__input(type='email', placeholder='you@example.com', required)
        .form__group.ma-bt-md
          label.form__label(for='password') Password
          input#password.form__input(type='password', placeholder='········', required, minlength='8', autocomplete='on')
        .form__group
          button.btn--green(name='submit') Login
